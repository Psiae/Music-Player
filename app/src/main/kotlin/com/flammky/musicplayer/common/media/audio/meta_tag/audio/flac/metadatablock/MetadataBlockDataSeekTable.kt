/**
 * SeekTable Block
 *
 *
 * This is an optional block for storing seek points. It is possible to seek to any given sample in a FLAC stream
 * without a seek table, but the delay can be unpredictable since the bitrate may vary widely within a stream.
 * By adding seek points to a stream, this delay can be significantly reduced. Each seek point takes 18 bytes, so 1%
 * resolution within a stream adds less than 2k. There can be only one SEEKTABLE in a stream, but the table can have
 * any number of seek points. There is also a special 'placeholder' seekpoint which will be ignored by decoders but
 * which can be used to reserve space for future seek point insertion.
 *
 * SEEKPOINT
 * <64> 	Sample number of first sample in the target frame, or 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF for a placeholder point.
 * <64> 	Offset (in bytes) from the first byte of the first frame header to the first byte of the target frame's header.
 * <16> 	Number of samples in the target frame.
 * NOTES
 *
 * For placeholder points, the second and third field values are undefined.
 * Seek points within a table must be sorted in ascending order by sample number.
 * Seek points within a table must be unique by sample number, with the exception of placeholder points.
 * The previous two notes imply that there may be any number of placeholder points, but they must all occur at the end of the table.
